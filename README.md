STEP 1: install required dependencies via pip
requests
BeautifulSoup
datetime
twilio

STEP 2: download all the files and ensure they are in the same folder

STEP 3: download python 3.7 and run "Master.py" via command line

STEP 4(TO RECIEVE TEXTS): change your phone number in the sections where it is used

IF THE TEXT ALERTS DO NOT WORK IT MEANS THAT THE ACCOUNT USED IS OUT OF FREE TRIAL CREDIT
SORRY, contact me if you wish to use the program and this is the case i'll substitute the expired credentials with functional ones

We were motiated to get this program so that people are more easily able to get the courses that they want, we both had courses that filled up before our registration period opened, so as opposed to checking back irregularily and hoping that spot is open for the class you want, we decided to develop a solution. Simply run the program and get text alerts when classes open up.
